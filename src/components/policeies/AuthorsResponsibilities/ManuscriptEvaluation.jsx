        <li>Completion of the study</li>
        <li>Novelty of the research</li>
        <li>
          Style of presentation (the following should not be used: elements of

        <li>Correctness and accuracy of use of terms</li>
        <li>Validity of the relevance of the research problem</li>
        <li>
          Completeness of the literature review, including publications in the
          “PJ” on similar issues; limitation of self-citations by the Authors to five references to their own works
        </li>
        <li>Consistency of the theoretical hypothesis, goal, research hypotheses, objectives, methodological techniques, results obtained, conclusions</li>

        <li>Correctness of the formulations of the theoretical hypothesis, goals and research hypotheses</li>
        <li>Representativeness of the sample</li>
        <li>Adequacy of sample size</li>
        <li>Representativeness, validity and reliability of methodological techniques</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Additional criteria for evaluating manuscripts of information-analytical and critical-analytical literature reviews:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Irreparable deficiencies that constitute grounds for rejection of the review manuscript:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Incompleteness of the review (for example, only monographs are presented, not articles, modern works are missing)</li>
          <li>The review contains abstracts of the works, not their analysis</li>
          <li>Distortion of cited sources</li>
        </ul>
