        V. Authors' responsibilities and the sequence of work with the manuscript
        in the editorial office of the "Psychological Journal"
      </h2>

      <p>
        The editors ask authors to submit materials via regular mail.
        Correspondence marked "Valuable" will not be delivered to the editorial office.
      </p>

      <p>
        "PJ" accepts for consideration, including peer review and possible publication,
        no more than one manuscript per Author per year in any of the genres stipulated
        by the "PJ" Rules. If an article has multiple Authors, this applies to the Principal Author
        (i.e., the first in the list of co-authors), who bears primary responsibility for the
        content and formatting of the manuscript. However, within one year, a manuscript is
        also accepted for consideration in which the author, who was the sole or Principal
        Author of an article already published in "PJ" this year, may become one of the co-authors
        (but not the Principal Author) of the submitted new work. The content of the latter must
        meet the requirements of originality and novelty (see Section III).
      </p>

      <p>
        The editors also reserve the right to make exceptions to this rule in certain cases,
        for example, for commissioned and/or anniversary materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acceptance for consideration of a manuscript consisting of several parts is possible
        only upon receipt by the editors of all parts, i.e. the manuscript in its entirety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Manuscripts that are not formatted in accordance with the Rules of the Journal are
        returned to the authors for revision without review by reviewers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Manuscripts submitted for review to "PJ" are registered with the editors and sent
        for review only if the author has entered into a License Agreement with Nauka Publishing
        House for the right to use their scientific work in scientific journals founded by the
        Russian Academy of Sciences (in RAS Journals) (see Appendix No. 1). The text of the
        Agreement is posted on the Nauka Publishing House website (www.naukaran.ru). The
        completed Agreement is sent to the editors in electronic form (including a scanned signature)
        along with the manuscript. If mailing is not required, a paper version of the Agreement
        with the author's signature may be submitted directly to the "PJ" Editorial Board.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team of authors indicates one of the authors with whom the editors will conduct
        negotiations and correspondence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The editorial board of "PZ" determines whether to accept or reject a manuscript
        based on reviews by independent experts appointed by the editorial board. The experts'
        independence is ensured by their anonymity, which is guaranteed by the Editor-in-Chief.
        The author does not have the right to choose the reviewer! Reviews received at the
        author's initiative will not be considered.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reviewer's feedback is intended for the author and the members of the editorial board.
      </p>

      <p>
        "PJ" reserves the right to request that the author provide raw data for processing
        if reviewers or editorial board members have questions. In case of refusal, the manuscript
        will be rejected. This requirement remains in effect for 5 years after publication,
        and copyright to the submitted materials remains in effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the review of a manuscript prior to its publication, reviewers and members
        of the editorial board do not have the right (without special permission from the author)
        to use the submitted materials for other purposes, such as developing and promoting
        their own research.
      </p>

      <p>
        The manuscript is sent to the author for revision after the review is submitted. In
        the case of positive reviews that contain the reviewer's comments, the authors analyze
        the comments and make revisions to the manuscript accordingly. The author's response
        should list the textual changes made in accordance with the reviewer's comments. If
        the authors disagree with any comment, this disagreement must be justified in the response
        to the reviewer. Ignoring reviewer comments is unacceptable!
      </p>

      <p>
        The revised version of the manuscript is submitted for review and a decision is made.
        Revision of the manuscript is permitted by special decision of the Editorial Board.
        The author should resolve any disagreements with the reviewer during the initial revision
        and in their response to the reviewer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The editors' work with the manuscript begins after the reviewer's recommendation
        for publication comes into effect or the conflict situation is resolved by the editorial board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acceptance of a manuscript for publication or its rejection comes into effect after
        the decision of the editorial board.
      </p>

      <p>
        The editors allow the publication of a reviewer's commentary along with the published
        work, as well as sending the manuscript for comment to specialists in the relevant field.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case of negative reviews and/or rejection of the article by decision of the editorial
        board, the Copyright Transfer Agreement does not come into force, of which the editorial
        board notifies the Author.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the manuscript is rejected, the author may radically revise it, including conducting
        additional research, etc., and then submit the revised manuscript to the “PJ” for
        reconsideration (in accordance with the procedure applied to newly submitted manuscripts).
      </p>

      <p>
        The editors do not return rejected manuscripts (in paper version).
      </p>

      <p>
        In case of contentious issues, decisions are made solely by the Editorial Board,
        not by the editors supervising the article. The Editorial Board's decision is final.
      </p>

      <p>
        The editors ask authors who discover errors in their published works to report them to “PJ”.
